1. 
Explore current thinking (blogs, online articles, videos etc) about Enterprise Integration. 
By Enterprise Integration I mean distributed scalable applications with data storage
that rely on diLerent ‘services’ or modules talking to each other. 
This means monolithic applications as well as microservices. 

2.
The result should be a report you can use to prepare for the exam 
(What is Enterprise Integration, what diagramming standards are there, what does the 
code for an integration pattern such as ‘pipes and filters’ look like?)
