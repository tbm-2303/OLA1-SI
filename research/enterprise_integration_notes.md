# Research on Enterprise Integration

Explore current thinking (blogs, online articles, videos etc) about EnterpriseIntegration. 
By Enterprise Integration I mean distributed scalable applications with data storage that 
rely on diLerent ‘services’ or modules talking to each other. 
This means monolithic applications as well as microservices.

1. Definition of Enterprise Integration

What is Enterprise Integration, and why is it important in modern systems?
The role of Enterprise Integration in connecting services, data stores, and applications.


2. Types of Enterprise Integration Patterns

- Focus on patterns such as:
- Pipes and Filters
- Message Bus
- Publish-Subscribe
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Microservices


3. Current Trends and Technologies

Look for blogs, articles, and videos discussing recent developments in Enterprise Integration.
Explore the move from monolithic to microservices architecture.
Explore integration technologies like Apache Camel, Spring Integration, or RabbitMQ.

## I) Integration Patterns in Software Development

Link: [Integration Patterns in Software Development](https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/applications-technology/integration-patterns-in-software-development/)

### Application Integration - Description 
Enterprise integration is the process of connecting multiple applications and systems to enable seamless communication and data sharing. 
Big applications has to handle complex tasks, as such they will need to interact with other application and systems to achieve this.  
Integration allows systems to work together to meet functional requirements (e.g., completing transactions) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, scalability).
##### - Functional integration: How systems communicate to fulfill business processes (e.g., order fulfillment).
##### - Non-functional integration: Ensuring performance, reliability, and security in integrated systems.

#### Example of application integration
When a user buys a pair of sunglasses on Amazon app, it must fulfill the order and bill the user when the sunglasses are delivered. 
In this case, the ordering system is integrated with the billing system and passes transactional data from the ordering system to the 
billing system, and confirmation from billing back to the ordering system. 


#### Integration patterns
In technical terms, by integration, we mean passing data back and forth, so they meet users’ functional requirements along with meeting
system’s non-functional requirements as well. But how data is passed back and forth matters and depends on what the specific use case is.
Integration patterns define methods for linking various applications. The three primary patterns are:
1. Data-Centric Integration
2. Event-Driven Integration
3. Application-Centric Integration

These patterns help solve challenges like data consistency, real-time responsiveness, and modular system design.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Data-Centric Integration
- Focus on SST(single source of truth): 
The primary goal is to have a centralized and authoritative data repository, ensuring that all 
applications within the organization access consistent and accurate information.

#### Common patterns associated with data-centric integration:
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): 
  - Description: Moves, and validates, data from diverse sources into a central repository, often a data warehouse or data lake.
  - Use Case: Useful for data consolidation, cleansing, and transformation before loading it into a target system.
  - Example: Data access from a data warehouse to data science team for analytics purposes
  - We learned about this during sem. 4 of DAT in business intelligence course. This is common technique for
handling data before storing it in datawarehouse. Common and sometimes intensive preprocessing of data can be done away from the target system. 

- File Transfer:
  - Description: Securely transfers large datasets between systems, often in batch mode.
  - Use Case: Efficient for moving bulk data between applications and systems.
  - Example: An enterprise sending employee information to a payroll processing company.

- Shared Database:
  - Description: Consolidates data into a single database accessible to multiple applications.
  - Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where multiple applications need to interact with and share a common set of data.
  - Example: Operational data store where customer transactions are processed and stored.
	
- Data Replication:
  - Description: Maintains synchronized copies of data across multiple systems.
  - Use Case: Enables real-time or near-real-time access to data across distributed environments.
  - Example: Caching data for read-only purposes to provide status to the end use.
	
- Aggregation: 
  - Description: Gathers data from multiple sources for reporting and analytics.
  - Use Case: Useful for creating consolidated views of data for reporting and analysis purposes.
  - Example: Data lake, data warehouse.

	

#### Benefits:

- Consistency: Ensures that all applications are using consistent and up-to-date data.
- Efficiency: Reduces redundancy and enhances efficiency by avoiding duplicate data storage.
- Accuracy: Facilitates accurate reporting and analytics by providing a reliable data foundation.
 
#### Key Considerations:

1. Data Quality and Consistency: Ensuring data quality and consistency is crucial to maintain the integrity of the single source of truth.
2. Security and Compliance: Implementing security measures to protect data during transfer and ensuring compliance with regulations.
3. Scalability: Designing integration solutions that can scale to handle growing volumes of data and evolving business requirements.
4. Monitoring and Management: Establishing monitoring mechanisms to track data movement, detect issues, and ensure timely resolution.
5. Metadata Management: Managing metadata is essential for understanding the structure, origin, and lineage of the integrated data.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Event-Driven Integration
Definition: Event-driven integration enables systems to respond to real-time events without direct coupling between components.

#### Key Integration Techniques:
- Message-Driven Communication: Systems exchange messages through message brokers, supporting real-time updates and notifications.
  - Example: Real-time updates on order status from an e-commerce system.
- Event-Driven Communication: Events are broadcasted, and systems independently react to them.
  - Example: An IoT thermostat sending temperature data to its server for analysis.



#### Key Considerations:
- Scalability: Event-driven systems handle large numbers of asynchronous events.
- Error Handling: Systems must manage failures and retries.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Application-Centric Integration
Definition: This approach emphasizes modular design and reusability by using well-defined interfaces like APIs.

#### Key Integration Techniques:
- Facade: Simplifies complex systems by offering a unified API.
  - Example: A user interface for an e-commerce platform that hides the complexity of multiple backend services.
- Adapter: Translates data between systems with incompatible formats.
  - Example: Integrating a modern payment gateway with an older e-commerce system.
- Content-Based Routing: Dynamically routes messages based on their content.
  - Example: An email system routing messages based on keywords.


#### Key Considerations:
- API Design: Ensure consistency and simplicity in API development.
- Modularity: Break down applications into smaller, reusable services.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Conclusion
Enterprise integration patterns offer multiple ways to connect systems, each with unique benefits depending on the use case.

- Data-Centric patterns suit scenarios where consistent, reliable data is needed.
- Event-Driven patterns are ideal for real-time responsiveness and scalability.
- Application-Centric patterns focus on modularity, enabling scalable and maintainable system design.

By understanding and applying these patterns, organizations can build efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems to meet both current and future needs.
